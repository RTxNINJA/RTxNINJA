## Hey, I'm Muhammed Alkurdi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17-year-old programmer from Iraq, currently living in Lisbon, Portugal, and I'm pursuing the IB DP. Python's my jam, and I'm diving into Swift, with some experience in Java, C#, and more. I have over 3 years of programming experience and have recently started freelancing, landing my first client through Discord.

Let's connect and code together! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
